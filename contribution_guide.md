# Contribution Guidelines for ML Samples Project

Welcome to the **ML Samples for Beginners** repository! We’re thrilled to have you contribute and help us build a robust learning resource for aspiring machine learning practitioners. Below are the contribution guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
- Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/learn_machine_learning
```

### 2. Explore Issues or Propose New Ideas
- Look for open issues labeled as "good first issue" or "help wanted."
- If you have a new feature or project idea, feel free to open an issue to discuss it with the community before starting.

### 3. Work on the Issue
- Create a new branch for the issue you're working on.
  
```
git checkout -b issue-123-branch-name
```

- Keep your changes focused on a single issue to keep things clear and concise.
- Make sure to add comments and documentation in your code to help others understand it easily.

### 4. Add Documentation and Tests
- Always include documentation for new code or models you introduce. Each model should have:
  - A brief description of the algorithm.
  - A step-by-step guide on how to run it.
  - A sample dataset (if required).
- If applicable, include tests to ensure that your code works as expected.

### 5. Follow the Code Style Guidelines
- Stick to Python’s [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding style.
- Use clear and meaningful variable names, and maintain readability.
  
### 6. Submit a Pull Request (PR)
- Once your code is ready, push it to your forked repository and open a pull request (PR) against the main repository.
- Ensure your PR description explains:
  - What changes were made.
  - Which issue it addresses (link to the issue number).
  - Any additional information that might help with the review.

### 7. Review Process
- PRs will be reviewed by the maintainers. Please be patient, as it may take a few days to get feedback.
- Make the necessary changes if requested and push them to your branch.

## Code of Conduct
By participating, you agree to uphold the project’s [Code of Conduct](link to code of conduct file). Be respectful and considerate of others.

## Contribution Tips
- Start small by fixing bugs or improving documentation if you’re new to the project.
- Ensure any large changes are first discussed in an issue before proceeding with them.
- Keep your commits clean and organized. Write meaningful commit messages.
- Do not include unnecessary files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, compiled binaries) in your PR.
